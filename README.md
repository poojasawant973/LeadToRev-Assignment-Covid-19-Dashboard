# LeadToRev-Assignment-Covid-19-Dashboard
This Project is a COVID-19 dashboard build using React.js. It shows covid-19 data like total cases, recoveries and deaths for different countries.

In this project, I focused on fetching live COVID-19 data using APIs and showingn it nicely charts and stats. I change the UI from the mockup and designed my own version. It looks different, but I kept full focus on functionality and user experience.
