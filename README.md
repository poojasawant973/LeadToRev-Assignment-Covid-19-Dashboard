# LeadToRev-Assignment-Covid-19-Dashboard

This Project is a COVID-19 dashboard build using React.js. It shows covid-19 data like total cases, recoveries and deaths for different countries.

For this project, I worked on fetching real-time data from APIs and displaying it with charts and stats in a clean way. I didn't just copy the mockup - I changed the UI and made my own version that looks different but keeps everything working well and easy to use.

## Features

- Show total COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries
- You can choose any country from the dropdown
- Loader while data is loading and error handling if something goes wrong
- Fully responsive - Works well on both phones and desktop


## How to run this project

- clone this repo
- run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
- Run 'npm start' to start the project
- open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see it


## Techonologies I used

- React
- Recharts for charts
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React icons
- Lodash for utility functions
- disease.sh API to get COVID-19 data

I updated the UI after the initial submission to improve the look and user experience. This live link shows the newest version.

I build everything myself, focused on keeping it simple and working well. If you want, you can suggest improvements or ask questions.

Thanks for checking out my project!
